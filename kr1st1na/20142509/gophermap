/////Dream Logs/////

The window smashed open as I woke up abruptly. Wind and hail came through the curtains ripping the rod off of the wall. Lightning illuminated the dark space and blinded me as a loud train-like noise approached from a distance. I tried my best to grab the cat(s) (they weren’t all mine), but they all scrambled and I couldn’t catch them.

The loud, deep whistle approached and sucked me out of my window. I was scraped and thrown about, up miles into the the air. The cyclone consumed me.

Although terrified I began moving slowly, looking downwards at my home and my city. I felt myself hover for a second as I began descending back to the earth. I saw each of my cats in the air within the tornado as I quickly fell to the ground. 

As I hit the ground I woke up.
